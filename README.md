# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

A simple three column card, i used CSS grid to create a responsive layout for the card, and used the provided figma design to create this layout. I used media query to ensure that the layout of the card would comform to the figma design for mobile screens with a screen width of 375px.
